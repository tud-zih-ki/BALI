the world is undoubtedly a verticality-oriented one. the human race is inexorably tied to the gravity of earth, of the planet, and with that the directionlessness of outer space is not the natural place for them. why, then, can the ocean's depths be so alien? it should be closer to home than anything. it's near to the heart of the earth, and it echoes with the heart of humanity. the verticality is clear, as you descend and the pressure increases, as your body folds quietly, acquiesced to earth's might. but the ocean isn't meant to be humanity's path to the bottom. they're meant to find it another way. the ocean is vast and uncaring. the lives it has claimed and the misery it's caused might bring one to think it's evil. it isn't, however. it is, in the eyes of many, the embodiment of vast ambivalence. its forceful grandeur cares not for your fate when you pass the threshold. it only does as it does because it does. the tide dips and swells for only its own sake; the waves crash upon gray stones for no reason but simply to crash. the ocean doesn't take and give life as it pleases, for it favors no one and no thing. many assign to the ocean intent, as is the consistent human nature of pattern detection and personification. this mistake is forgivable, but even if the human mind were distinguished enough to discern the ocean's intent, what they would find might crush what sense of reality remained in a still-fragile skull. that intent means nothing to the experience of an individual.
growing up in chondalwood, i lived alongside my family and clan. ghostwise halflings are known for our affinity to nature and our love of druidic practices and teachings. so, no one was surprised when i started using my innate magical abilities at a young age. with a family name moon, they had high expectations for me to be our next great protector. my clan however despised my love for the unknown. trying to sew generations of mistrust in order to keep the clan from leaving our home. they desired for me to stay in chondalwood and keep its inhabitants healthy and safe. i, fallon moon, however had different plans. my fondest memories consistently had one thing in common. i remember changing into a tiny green spider, climbing from tree to tree, seeking out the friendliest passing adventurers. always starting off conversations telepathically before climbing down in front of them and reveling my true form. quickly learning that many of them had never seen a ghostwise before in their lifetime. i would listen to as many stories as they would tell and spend countless hours daydreaming of unknown lands. so, when i turned 26, i decided to leave chondelwood behind and find my own stories to tell. lucky for me, on my second ten day, i found another clan, this one comprising of misfit adventurers, outside the south stone mines, near thornybrook. willing to aid and protect them in whatever is needed to and help them set up and find new catan. yet sometimes i still miss chondelwood and everyone back home. then i look at my staff, a piece of wood from my favorite tree back there. it was carved by bree leagallow, the leader of my old clan. remembering i'll always be able to find them again. h 1152
first i took up my abode in the woods, that is, began to spend my nights as well as days there, which, by accident, was on independence day, or the fourth of july, 1845, my house was not finished for winter, but was merely a defense against the rain, without plastering or chimney, the walls being of rough weather - stained boards, with wide chinks, which made it cool at night. the upright white hewn studs and freshly planed door and window casings gave it a clean and airy look, especially in the morning when its timbers were saturated with dew, so that i fancied that by noon some sweet gum would exude from them.... i was seated by the shore of a small pond, about a mile and a half south of the village of concord and somewhat higher than it, in the midst of an extensive wood between that town and known to fame, concord battle ground ; but i was so low in the woods that the opposite shore, half a mile off, like the rest, covered with wood, was my most distant horizon. for the first week, whenever i looked out on the pond it impressed me like a tarn high up on the side of a mountain, its bottom far above the surface of other lakes, and, as the sun arose, i saw it throwing off its nightly clothing of mist, and here and there by degrees, while the mists, like ghosts, were stealthily withdrawing in every direction into the woods, as at the breaking up of some nocturnal conventicler. the very dew seemed to hang upon the trees later into the day than usual, as on the sides of mountains....

large painting is of five women holding hands in a circular dance, on a field of green, before a bold blue sky. the sinuous, sensuous curves of the approximately life – size dancers in their circular swirl, convey a vivid sense of rhythm and movement. the painting is dominated by large expanses of just four colors. a hilly shape, in what might be described as emerald green suggests a lawn. it creates a wavy horizon where it meets the deep blue sky, about one – third of the way up the canvas. the five women wear no trace of clothing, and their skin is pale flesh, tinted with pink. the last color is a flat black that outlines the dancers and represents their shoulder length hair. on close examination, one can see that the black of their hair is sometimes tinted with brown or green, and the black that outlines the figures ranges from very dark, to almost gray. the overall application of color is fairly matte with very little glossiness. there is a sense of ' flatness ' to the scene. the dancers themselves might be two dimensional, cut from paper, for example. there is only the slight illusion of depth created by their circle of joined hands. the dancer at the left, and the one along the bottom of the painting face away and show only the backs of their heads and bodies – the two closest to the top face toward us – and the smallest figure to the right of the canvas is in profile. their legs are all in motion, however there is little or no sense that they are supporting the weight of real dancers. rather, in most cases their feet make light contact, or even float slightly above the green hillside.

I think this is a good way to draw a dragon, I can see how this is a bit moody and melancholy in its environment. I really enjoy imagining how medieval environments might look like in the future. I would love to have a dragon painting of my own. The use of the medieval environment to communicate the human form is both subtle and beautiful. This medieval setting looks so fun to work on. I wanted to commission a dragon, but no one could draw one. I think that the idea of a medieval environment looks very good! I just want to draw a dragon, and decorate it. I like the atmosphere of the medieval setting and the character's pose. The work here was an appropriate fit for a commission from an artist with a melancholic look. Dragon commission? This would look beautiful on my wall. I like to think of my work as part of an ongoing conversation in an old-world landscape. I think that medieval paintings are a good example of how to create a mood with your artwork. I like the idea of a painting in a medieval setting. I wonder if this is a commission from the artist. I love the way that these medieval style dragon forms are painted. I've always wanted to do some kind of space art. The art of this place makes me feel as if I am there. The dragon represents a more refined time when the earth was inhabited by the most noble and creative people. I would like to be a dragon with an art gallery and a cozy office. The concept of the dragon is very modern.
i couldn't help imagining that there was someone out there somewhere who was now amused by looking at me, how i had lived for the whole 3 0 - 4 0 years, learning, developing, growing in body and spirit, and how i was now, having completely strengthened my mind, having reached the peak of life from which it opens all of her, - like a fool i stand on this peak, clearly realizing that there is nothing in life, and there has never been, and there will never be. and it's funny to him... but whether or not there is someone who laughs at me, it doesn't make me feel any better. i could not give any reasonable meaning to any action, nor to my whole life. i was only surprised how i could not understand this at the very beginning. all this has been known to everyone for so long. not today, but tomorrow, diseases and death will come ( and they have already come ) on loved ones, on me, and nothing will remain but the stench and worms. my affairs, whatever they may be, will all be forgotten - sooner, later, and i will not be there. so why bother? how can a person not see this and live - that's what's amazing! you can only live as long as you are drunk with life ; and when you sober up, you can't help but see that all this is just a deception, and a stupid deception! that's right, that there is nothing even funny and witty, but simply cruel and stupid, another russian thinker, leo tolstoy, argues in his confession.
How we could make a whole new generation of people who are powerless to escape the confines of their surroundings and The art movements of the 70s were so full of the spirit of the human condition. I believe we should see all of these art movements as symbolic, because they are the ones that are truly The era of the future is marked by the absence of an art system. The cultural evolution of man is in a state of flux. This is a very nice collection of images that are meant to represent the movement for social change and a call I think the greatest art movement is the one that was born out of alienation. The movement is meant to be an attempt to be more human than the mainstream. the artist Robert Summer is on the forefront of the new world order and a reminder of the need for a Robert Summer's work will be missed by the masses. I think the future is something like the current age of art and technology. The future is about us coming I wonder what the reaction will be to the public exhibition of art movements from the 1980s? I bet that the artist was inspired by the same social upheaval as me when I was in high school. I think the only thing left of humanity is the desire to preserve its individuality. I like to imagine that the future is where we are all going. I can't help but think that The cover of this exhibition was designed to inspire us to explore new ways of thinking The idealism of the early 80's The world has lost the ability to control its own destiny.

merida is the lady of the western painting. this is a good looking painting of a female warrior with a viking mask. this painting of a fair maiden is an accurate representation of the viking period. merida is a female viking warrior. she is a very aggressive person. she is probably very well trained. the painting of the fair maiden is a classic for the vikings. i'm pretty sure that this is the painting that merida is looking at from the start. a lady in a viking dress in an old painting. the viking female in the painting, has been kidnapped. merida, the fair maiden is a very mysterious figure. merry merida, i'm not much of a painter. if she had the courage to paint with a spear, she would have been a fair and merriest of warrior. that is an old painting of the viking woman. she looks like she might have been part of the viking war party. i've seen more than enough viking paintings to be sure that this is a good example of the genre. the woman's face is a bit too a fair maiden painted on a wall in a viking ship. merida is the princess of the dark arts. she could kill anyone if she wanted. the image of a woman in a viking warrior outfit. merida's beauty is often taken for granted. i am glad to know that the beauty of this painting is the same as the beauty of the viking's warriors. i see the woman in the painting is a viking. this viking woman is looking for a fair maiden.

This computer rendering looks like a brain-in-a-vat, but is actually a brain-in-a-vat The computer renders of the brain This is a computer rendering of the human brain. These people are not thinking clearly. Their brain displays something else, a virtual computer, and it looks like an alien looking at a monitor A very sophisticated computer render of a human body with no sensory input. This computer rendering is a very high art. I don't know if this is a computer painting or a picture of a person having a seizure, but I don't care. I I am an avid consumer of computer graphics, and this is just a computer rendering, no wonder I am so anxious. The way in which the brain processes information from the computer makes me feel like I am in a computer simulation. The computer can be seen as a metaphor for the way human beings process information. I want to see what the actual computer is doing when it's rendering the image. The human mind is an astonishing machine, even at the most advanced computer of its age. Computer graphics are not just for art! The computer art I created is very complex. I am not sure what the meaning of the computer is but it must be a work of art or an illusion. I can't wait to get my brain scanned on a computer. I love the artistry of the computers on display in this painting. A computer renders such exquisite detail, it would take a lifetime to get the same level of technical skill. A computer display on the verge of an existential crisis.
life size painting of two young girls in a garden lighting chinese paper lanterns in the twilight. the two girls are polly and dolly barnard, daughters of a friend, chosen because they had the exact hair colour sargent was seeking. dolly, aged eleven, is on the left ; polly, aged seven, is on the right. both girls wear white summer dresses with frilly necks, like cotton nighties, which cover them completely from their necks down to below the knee. the dresses are very full and billowy, and have full length puffy sleeves. the white fabric picks up and reflects the orange coloured light of the paper lanterns that surround them, suspended from a horizontal line which is strung and wound between tall lily stems. the two girls stand almost knee deep in the carnations which grow upwards and diagonally from the ground, wearing black boots. they have light brown hair cut short above their necks. dolly, in the centre of the canvas, is positioned with her back slightly turned towards us so we see her face in profile. the sisters are surrounded by flowers ; deep burgundy and cream carnations on blue - green stems in the lower quarter of the composition, pink and white roses to either side of them and tall creamy white lilies all around and above them. there are eight more globe and tube shaped paper lanterns hanging from the line strung between the branches and stems around the girls each one glowing orangey pink and looking remarkable against the darker colour of the leaves and stems which surround them.

, oil paint, the foreground is filled with light, mainly falling on a group of girls in fine dresses, and also, although less harshly, on a man on the left side of the picture, who appears to be a painter. elements further back in the image, including two additional figures, are in shadow, except for a distant doorway with the silhouette of a man, and an illuminated image of a man and a woman inside a frame on the back wall. there are eleven people depicted here : eight inside the room, the man in the doorway, and the two figures inside the frame. there is a dog lying down at the front right, at the feet of one of the girls, who is a dwarf. it is likely that the man has been depicted as if he were studying the subject of his painting. if this were a photograph, we might say that he was looking into the camera. on the back wall of the picture there are four framed images, placed close together in two rows up to ceiling height, almost obscuring the wall. the upper two pictures and the bottom left one are in darkness and their subject matter cannot be identified. the brighter image has refracted light at its edges suggesting that this may not be a picture at all, but a mirror reflecting a situation that cannot otherwise be seen. the position of the mirror and that of the painter suggests that the two people in the mirror are the painter ' s models.

Then I looked, and behold, a whirlwind was coming out of the north, a great cloud with raging fire engulfing itself; and brightness was all around it and radiating out of its midst like the color of amber, out of the midst of the fire. Also from within it came the likeness of four living creatures. And this was their appearance: they had the likeness of a man. Each one had four faces, and each one had four wings. Their legs were straight, and the soles of their feet were like the soles of calves' feet. They sparkled like the color of burnished bronze. The hands of a man were under their wings on their four sides; and each of the four had faces and wings. Their wings touched one another. The creatures did not turn when they went, but each one went straight forward. As for the likeness of their faces, each had the face of a man; each of the four had the face of a lion on the right side, each of the four had the face of an ox on the left side, and each of the four had the face of an eagle. Thus were their faces.

this is a small, framed painting, in a dreamlike landscape, giant watches dominate the foreground. but they ' re like no watch you ' d find in the waking world : they ' re soft, and they ' re draped over other objects in the scenery like discarded clothing. beginning with the landscape, it seems to be a desolate coastal region. the bottom two – thirds of the canvas is occupied by a dark brown, flat expanse of sand that is deep in shadow. but the upper portion of the sand is a lighter brown, with the calm, light blue sea in the distance ; and the top third of the painting has yellow sky that graduates into deep blue at the very top of the painting. the position of the objects in this painting will be indicated using the analogy of the face of a clock. at the top right, or at one o ' clock, a sunlit high ridge of rocky land juts into the sea. in the bottom left of the painting, from 7 o ' clock to 9 o ' clock is the corner of a brown wooden platform upon which the artist ' s signature is barely visible. from it sprouts a grayish, withered tree : lopped off at the top, with not a leaf in sight, extending one thin branch out to the right. over this branch is draped one of the watches. it ' s an old – fashioned. a second, similar pocket watch is draped over the edge of the platform below. it ' s huge, almost the same size as the stunted tree above it. the lower half hangs limply over the edge, like an over – ripe cheese melting in the sun. it is gold with a blue face and the time reads 6 : 5 5. a fly sits just below the 1 2 and casts a shadow on the face of the watch. a third watch lies below and just to the left of it – a gold one, its face hidden in its case. it ' s crawling with ants : an unexpected and disconcerting sight.

I hope that people around the world can find some peace
I'm walking on an oblong island under South America with a sijay in the village. There's a big fairgrounds there that we were walking through and decided to go in the back of it and found a trapdoor. I went down under the hatch and found myself in a metal room with flecks of some white matter in it. Then I found a way out. I walked out of the skimpy white whale over a metal bridge into a big rusty room. I huffed a little, but decided to go down to the bottom. Finding nothing there, I decided to go upstairs, but the ladder was gone. I looked at my hand and found a phallot pip boy there and turned on the light on it. The ladder appeared. I climbed up it and found another ladder in the corner, which I took to the outside. A little later I discovered that I had lost something (my cell phone, it seems) and we decide to go back to this island, but instead we end up on some island in Japan. There we started asking the local peasants and they said it was the country of Japan. They thought we were journalists and started shouting that it was very difficult to live in Japan and they wanted to go to Russia for a factory. Then we found ourselves in the right village and I saw the same hatch next to some Chinese man's counter and climbed into it. It was very hot in there, so I took off my jacket and hat (before I didn't notice that I was wearing them) and only then I thought it was hot and not cold. So we went behind this fairgrounds, found this trapdoor there, I climbed into it

i lived alongside my family and clan. ghostwise halflings are known for our affinity to nature and our love of druidic practices and teachings. so, no one was surprised when i started using my innate magical abilities at a young age. with a family name moon, they had high expectations for me to be our next great protector. my clan however despised my love for the unknown. trying to sew generations of mistrust in order to keep the clan from leaving our home. they desired for me to stay and keep its inhabitants healthy and safe. i, fallon moon had different plans. i remember changing into a tiny green spider, climbing from tree to tree, seeking out the friendliest passing adventurers, and always starting conversations telepathically before climbing down in front of them and revealing my true form. quickly learning that many of them had never seen a ghostwise before in their lifetime. i would listen to as many stories as they would tell and spend countless hours daydreaming of unknown lands. so, when i turned 26, i decided to leave home behind and find my own stories to tell. lucky for me, on my second ten day, i found another clan, comprising of misfit adventurers, outside the south stone mines. willing to aid and protect them in whatever is needed to and help them set up and find new catan. yet sometimes i still miss chondelwood and everyone back home. then i look at my staff, a piece of wood from my favorite tree back there carved by bree leagallow, the leader of my old clan. remembering i'll always be able to find them again. painterly illustration + by wlop, peter mohrbacher, gerald brom, james jean, craig mullins, alphonse mucha, mike mignola, akihiko yoshida h 768
Standing at roughly 5"7', Annora looks very, very different from most people around them. Mint green skin, swirling, mysterious tattoos dotting her arms and legs, and violet-lilac eyes, depending on the lighting. Her hair is extremely long, almost a hindrance had she not been accustomed to it her entire life, measuring down to her hips, with slight waves and curls giving it shape, with the occasional messy braid within, clearly done in a hurry just to manage it slightly. Their ears are forked, with two tips, stacked atop each other, but the most notable feature of theirs are their horns. Starting near the nape of her neck, they curl up and around the top of her head, above her ears, and take the shape of a laurel crown, with the same gold color typical of actual crowns. Her tongue, a more typical pink color, also has two silver stud piercings, vertical along the tongue. They are typically seen wearing a white blouse, with cut outs along the outsides of the forearms to show their tattoos and skin color. Their shoulders are covered by a caplet with a hood, often covered by her masses of hair, rarely ever usable and purely for aesthetic purposes. They wear fingerless gloves that are tight to the skin up to just below the elbow. Around their hips are a sash with a belt over the top, which is where their weapons hang from, a rapier on their left hip and a dagger on the front left side of the belt. Finally, they wear black pants and brown heeled boots that go up to just below the knee.
Jan Steen arranges the various actors as though on a theatre stage. The gentle depth of the composition is based on a triangle, with the magnificently dressed young woman at its top point. Her clothing and seductive look identify her as a "loose-living" girl. She, however, is not the focus of the scene; that is provided by the lady of the house, who has fallen asleep at the table on the left. Her "absence" has resulted in the rest of the story: the dog is finishing the meat pie that was served on the table, one of the children is filching something from the cabinet on the wall ("opportunity makes the thief "), the little girl's brother is trying out a pipe, and the youngest child, sitting in his highchair, is playing carelessly with a string of pearls. His attention diverted to the side, a young man is trying to play a violin. Young people who continued to live at home were considered suspect in the popular culture of the Netherlands at the time. The prostitute in the foreground has already been mentioned: in a provocative gesture she holds a filled glass between the legs of the man of the house, while he dismisses with a grin the admonishment of the nun standing on the right. The duck on the shoulder of the man next to her identifies him as a Quaker, who urges the reading of pious texts. Finally, the pig in the doorway to the kitchen is an allusion to another proverb: "Neither cast ye your pearls before swine". Hanging above the heads of these sinners are the symbols of the penalty to be expected for unbridled, lustful behaviour: a sword and a crutch in a basket suspended from the ceiling. Luxuria extravagance. An interesting biographic detail: at times Steen had to earn a living by running an inn and a brewery. Hyperrealistic

this is a small, framed painting, in a dreamlike landscape, giant watches dominate the foreground. but they ' re like no watch you ' d find in the waking world : they ' re soft, and they ' re draped over other objects in the scenery like discarded clothing. beginning with the landscape, it seems to be a desolate coastal region. the bottom two – thirds of the canvas is occupied by a dark brown, flat expanse of sand that is deep in shadow. but the upper portion of the sand is a lighter brown, with the calm, light blue sea in the distance ; and the top third of the painting has yellow sky that graduates into deep blue at the very top of the painting. the position of the objects in this painting will be indicated using the analogy of the face of a clock. at the top right, or at one o ' clock, a sunlit high ridge of rocky land juts into the sea. in the bottom left of the painting, from 7 o ' clock to 9 o ' clock is the corner of a brown wooden platform upon which the artist ' s signature is barely visible. from it sprouts a grayish, withered tree : lopped off at the top, with not a leaf in sight, extending one thin branch out to the right. over this branch is draped one of the watches. it ' s an old – fashioned. a second, similar pocket watch is draped over the edge of the platform below. it ' s huge, almost the same size as the stunted tree above it. the lower half hangs limply over the edge, like an over – ripe cheese melting in the sun. it is gold with a blue face and the time reads 6 : 55. a fly sits just below the 12 and casts a shadow on the face of the watch. a third watch lies below and just to the left of it – a gold one, its face hidden in its case. it ' s crawling with ants : an unexpected and disconcerting sight.

i couldn't help imagining that there was someone out there somewhere who was now amused by looking at me, how i had lived for the whole 30 - 40 years, learning, developing, growing in body and spirit, and how i was now, having completely strengthened my mind, having reached the peak of life from which it opens all of her, - like a fool i stand on this peak, clearly realizing that there is nothing in life, and there has never been, and there will never be. and it's funny to him... but whether or not there is someone who laughs at me, it doesn't make me feel any better. i could not give any reasonable meaning to any action, nor to my whole life. i was only surprised how i could not understand this at the very beginning. all this has been known to everyone for so long. not today, but tomorrow, diseases and death will come and they have already come on loved ones, on me, and nothing will remain but the stench and worms. my affairs, whatever they may be, will all be forgotten - sooner, later, and i will not be there. so why bother? how can a person not see this and live - that's what's amazing! you can only live as long as you are drunk with life ; and when you sober up, you can't help but see that all this is just a deception, and a stupid deception! that's right, that there is nothing even funny and witty, but simply cruel and stupid, another russian thinker, leo tolstoy, argues in his confession.

cover artwork for a retro pixel art game wich plays in a distant future, an ancient human warrior is brought back from the dead to help in the fight against a not-so-smart clan of robots called The Synth who have taken over the galaxy. They brought all organic life to the brink of extinction, but a few powerful and crafty fighters have managed to escape and scattered all over the galaxy. Your mission is to travel to distant planets to destroy the Synth's main technology centres in order to slowly disrupt and undermine their production and rescue any humans you find during your adventures. Together you will be able to gather the power needed to defeat the Synth Brain and finally stop it's reign in order to bring peace to all humans. Synth Hunters is a game of combat and exploration set in a wacky and bubbly voxel world. Its dynamic combat system will require you to master 3 different disciplines: Melee, Range and Magic. Combining them as often as possible will be the key to performing powerful combos and defeating your enemies. The game prompts you to explore further and further into the galaxy, where each planet is a unique dungeon that you can only attempt to defeat once. Collecting resources and better equipment will allow you to overcome the current planet cluster to unlock the technology that will lead you to the next, more hostile cluster. You can also count on humans to rescue all over the galaxy: they will follow you back home to strengthen the mother planet where your camp is located., 8k
Alice looks sad. Beautiful, realistic look at this young woman. I love the way the artist captures the human essence in her avatars. I wish I had this realistic look for my avatar. I think that this is a very realistic look at an avatar. This avatar is very realistic in its representation of a female form. I would look for an avatar who had a realistic look. I wish the woman had a more realistic appearance, the character looks like she is on her death bed. I love the way this woman looks so alive, but it's a bit unrealistic and drab. I can't help but feel so insecure by the image of a female avatar. Alice looks like she is crying, but I can't make out the facial expressions. I can't believe my eyes are deceiving me when looking at that picture. It looks like a very realistic avatar I feel like I can barely stand the look on this avatar, and it looks so fake. I love the realism of the woman's pose, she seems very vulnerable. A realist look at this avatar. I find the avatar's realism attractive and sad. It reminds me of my own dark years of loneliness. The woman looks very much like her original avatar from the movie. this woman has beautiful facial expression this is not a photorealistic view at all, it is the face of an old woman who has died Beautiful image of a woman in the throes of grief. I'd love to take a picture of her as she looks vulnerable, but I doubt it. Melancholy as that girl looks in that photo.

This monster statue will not fall, but it can take down the entire city with the best of them The Giant is the most frightening of the mutant monsters, the only one I would ever want to work on. What is the purpose of the mutate statue. This giant statue represents all of the fears of humanity! It's the first time I've ever seen a statue of the giant mutant! The giant monster is the main feature of this statue, but it is in the center of the stage. The statue is not large enough for a proper statue, so the mutates have to fight it. The giant statue represents the most violent, bloodthirsty and greedy people in history. Gaia is the mother of all things, and I am her child. Gaia's dream of peace, creativity, and pleasure is so much more vibrant than mine. Gaia, I have visions of the earth becoming one with the cosmos. I am an oil painter, and I will paint the dreams of my ancestors. Gaia has been a powerful and active force throughout all of human history. This artwork is a testament to this. The artwork on the right shows the essence of the human spirit. It is the essence of Gaia. Gaia represents the process of creative expression through the art of the imagination. I'm sure that this is the image of the mother earth, I'm sure this is the image of the psychedelic Dream World. made of light, diffuse lighting, fantasy, intricate, elegant, highly detailed, lifelike, photorealistic, digital painting, artstation, illustration, concept art, smooth, sharp focus, art by John Collier and Albert Aublet and Krenz Cushart and Artem Demura and Alphonse Mucha
jan steen arranges the various actors as though on a theatre stage. the gentle depth of the composition is based on a triangle, with the magnificently dressed young woman at its top point. her clothing and seductive look identify her as a loose-living girl. she, however, is not the focus of the scene; that is provided by the lady of the house, who has fallen asleep at the table on the left. her absence has resulted in the rest of the story: the dog is finishing the meat pie that was served on the table, one of the children is filching something from the cabinet on the wall opportunity makes the thief, the little girl's brother is trying out a pipe, and the youngest child, sitting in his highchair, is playing carelessly with a string of pearls. his attention diverted to the side, a young man is trying to play a violin. young people who continued to live at home were considered suspect in the popular culture of the netherlands at the time. the prostitute in the foreground has already been mentioned: in a provocative gesture she holds a filled glass between the legs of the man of the house, while he dismisses with a grin the admonishment of the nun standing on the right. the duck on the shoulder of the man next to her identifies him as a quaker, who urges the reading of pious texts. finally, the pig in the doorway to the kitchen is an allusion to another proverb: neither cast ye your pearls before swine. hanging above the heads of these sinners are the symbols of the penalty to be expected for unbridled, lustful behaviour: a sword and a crutch in a basket suspended from the ceiling. luxuria extravagance. an interesting biographic detail: at times steen had to earn a living by running an inn and a brewery. hyperrealistic, 80mm.

alice looks sad. beautiful, realistic look at this young woman. i love the way the artist captures the human essence in her avatars. i wish i had this realistic look for my avatar. i think that this is a very realistic look at an avatar. this avatar is very realistic in its representation of a female form. i would look for an avatar who had a realistic look. i wish the woman had a more realistic appearance, the character looks like she is on her death bed. i love the way this woman looks so alive, but it's a bit unrealistic and drab. i can't help but feel so insecure by the image of a female avatar. alice looks like she is crying, but i can't make out the facial expressions. i can't believe my eyes are deceiving me when looking at that picture. it looks like a very realistic avatar i feel like i can barely stand the look on this avatar, and it looks so fake. i love the realism of the woman's pose, she seems very vulnerable. a realist look at this avatar. i find the avatar's realism attractive and sad. it reminds me of my own dark years of loneliness. the woman looks very much like her original avatar from the movie. this woman has beautiful facial expression this is not a photorealistic view at all, it is the face of an old woman who has died beautiful image of a woman in the throes of grief. i'd love to take a picture of her as she looks vulnerable, but i doubt it. melancholy as that girl looks in that photo.

The world is undoubtedly a verticality-oriented one. The human race is inexorably tied to the gravity of Earth, of the planet, and with that the directionlessness of outer space is not the natural place for them. Why, then, can the ocean's depths be so alien? It should be closer to home than anything. It's near to the heart of the Earth, and it echoes with the heart of humanity. The verticality is clear, as you descend and the pressure increases, as your body folds quietly, acquiesced to Earth's might. But the ocean isn't meant to be humanity's path to the bottom. They're meant to find it another way. The ocean is vast and uncaring. The lives it has claimed and the misery it's caused might bring one to think it's evil. It isn't, however. It is, in the eyes of many, the embodiment of vast ambivalence. Its forceful grandeur cares not for your fate when you pass the threshold. It only does as it does because it does. The tide dips and swells for only its own sake; the waves crash upon gray stones for no reason but simply to crash. The ocean doesn't take and give life as it pleases, for it favors no one and no thing. Many assign to the ocean intent, as is the consistent human nature of pattern detection and personification. This mistake is forgivable, but even if the human mind were distinguished enough to discern the ocean's intent, what they would find might crush what sense of reality remained in a still-fragile skull. That intent means nothing to the experience of an individual.

i'm walking on an oblong island under south america with a sijay in the village. there's a big fairgrounds there that we were walking through and decided to go in the back of it and found a trapdoor. i went down under the hatch and found myself in a metal room with flecks of some white matter in it. then i found a way out. i walked out of the skimpy white whale over a metal bridge into a big rusty room. i huffed a little, but decided to go down to the bottom. finding nothing there, i decided to go upstairs, but the ladder was gone. i looked at my hand and found a phallot pip boy there and turned on the light on it. the ladder appeared. i climbed up it and found another ladder in the corner, which i took to the outside. a little later i discovered that i had lost something my cell phone, it seems and we decide to go back to this island, but instead we end up on some island in japan. there we started asking the local peasants and they said it was the country of japan. they thought we were journalists and started shouting that it was very difficult to live in japan and they wanted to go to russia for a factory. then we found ourselves in the right village and i saw the same hatch next to some chinese man's counter and climbed into it. it was very hot in there, so i took off my jacket and hat before i didn't notice that i was wearing them and only then i thought it was hot and not cold. so we went behind this fairgrounds, found this trapdoor there, i climbed into it
Growing up in Chondalwood, I lived alongside my family and clan. Ghostwise Halflings are known for our affinity to nature and our love of druidic practices and teachings. So, no one was surprised when I started using my innate magical abilities at a young age. With a family name Moon, they had high expectations for me to be our next great protector. My clan however despised my love for the unknown. Trying to sew generations of mistrust in order to keep the clan from leaving our home. They desired for me to stay in Chondalwood and keep its inhabitants healthy and safe. I, Fallon Moon, however had different plans. My fondest memories consistently had one thing in common. I remember changing into a tiny green spider, climbing from tree to tree, seeking out the friendliest passing adventurers. Always starting off conversations telepathically before climbing down in front of them and reveling my true form. Quickly learning that many of them had never seen a Ghostwise before in their lifetime. I would listen to as many stories as they would tell and spend countless hours daydreaming of unknown lands. So, when I turned 26, I decided to leave Chondelwood behind and find my own stories to tell. Lucky for me, on my second ten day, I found another clan, this one comprising of misfit adventurers, outside the South Stone mines, near Thornybrook. Willing to aid and protect them in whatever is needed to and help them set up and find New Catan. Yet sometimes I still miss Chondelwood and everyone back home. Then I look at my staff, a piece of wood from my favorite tree back there. It was carved by Bree Leagallow, the leader of my old clan. Remembering I'll always be able to find them again. H 1152
standing at roughly 57', annora looks very, very different from most people around them. mint green skin, swirling, mysterious tattoos dotting her arms and legs, and violet-lilac eyes, depending on the lighting. her hair is extremely long, almost a hindrance had she not been accustomed to it her entire life, measuring down to her hips, with slight waves and curls giving it shape, with the occasional messy braid within, clearly done in a hurry just to manage it slightly. their ears are forked, with two tips, stacked atop each other, but the most notable feature of theirs are their horns. starting near the nape of her neck, they curl up and around the top of her head, above her ears, and take the shape of a laurel crown, with the same gold color typical of actual crowns. her tongue, a more typical pink color, also has two silver stud piercings, vertical along the tongue. they are typically seen wearing a white blouse, with cut outs along the outsides of the forearms to show their tattoos and skin color. their shoulders are covered by a caplet with a hood, often covered by her masses of hair, rarely ever usable and purely for aesthetic purposes. they wear fingerless gloves that are tight to the skin up to just below the elbow. around their hips are a sash with a belt over the top, which is where their weapons hang from, a rapier on their left hip and a dagger on the front left side of the belt. finally, they wear black pants and brown heeled boots that go up to just below the knee.
jan steen arranges the various actors as though on a theatre stage. the gentle depth of the composition is based on a triangle, with the magnificently dressed young woman at its top point. her clothing and seductive look identify her as a loose-living girl. she, however, is not the focus of the scene; that is provided by the lady of the house, who has fallen asleep at the table on the left. her absence has resulted in the rest of the story: the dog is finishing the meat pie that was served on the table, one of the children is filching something from the cabinet on the wall opportunity makes the thief, the little girl's brother is trying out a pipe, and the youngest child, sitting in his highchair, is playing carelessly with a string of pearls. his attention diverted to the side, a young man is trying to play a violin. young people who continued to live at home were considered suspect in the popular culture of the netherlands at the time. the prostitute in the foreground has already been mentioned: in a provocative gesture she holds a filled glass between the legs of the man of the house, while he dismisses with a grin the admonishment of the nun standing on the right. the duck on the shoulder of the man next to her identifies him as a quaker, who urges the reading of pious texts. finally, the pig in the doorway to the kitchen is an allusion to another proverb: neither cast ye your pearls before swine. hanging above the heads of these sinners are the symbols of the penalty to be expected for unbridled, lustful behaviour: a sword and a crutch in a basket suspended from the ceiling. luxuria extravagance. an interesting biographic detail: at times steen had to earn a living by running an inn and a brewery. hyperrealistic
i think this is a good way to draw a dragon, i can see how this is a bit moody and melancholy in its environment. i really enjoy imagining how medieval environments might look like in the future. i would love to have a dragon painting of my own. the use of the medieval environment to communicate the human form is both subtle and beautiful. this medieval setting looks so fun to work on. i wanted to commission a dragon, but no one could draw one. i think that the idea of a medieval environment looks very good! i just want to draw a dragon, and decorate it. i like the atmosphere of the medieval setting and the character's pose. the work here was an appropriate fit for a commission from an artist with a melancholic look. dragon commission? this would look beautiful on my wall. i like to think of my work as part of an ongoing conversation in an old-world landscape. i think that medieval paintings are a good example of how to create a mood with your artwork. i like the idea of a painting in a medieval setting. i wonder if this is a commission from the artist. i love the way that these medieval style dragon forms are painted. i've always wanted to do some kind of space art. the art of this place makes me feel as if i am there. the dragon represents a more refined time when the earth was inhabited by the most noble and creative people. i would like to be a dragon with an art gallery and a cozy office. the concept of the dragon is very modern.
a great example of how the nervous system creates the illusion of visual images on a computer monitor. a young computer programmer is attempting to create a virtual painting of the human brain. a computer rendering of the brain. this computer rendering looks like a brain-in-a-vat, but is actually a brain-in-a-vat the computer renders of the brain this is a computer rendering of the human brain. these people are not thinking clearly. their brain displays something else, a virtual computer, and it looks like an alien looking at a monitor a very sophisticated computer render of a human body with no sensory input. this computer rendering is a very high art. i don't know if this is a computer painting or a picture of a person having a seizure, but i don't care. i i am an avid consumer of computer graphics, and this is just a computer rendering, no wonder i am so anxious. the way in which the brain processes information from the computer makes me feel like i am in a computer simulation. the computer can be seen as a metaphor for the way human beings process information. i want to see what the actual computer is doing when it's rendering the image. the human mind is an astonishing machine, even at the most advanced computer of its age. computer graphics are not just for art! the computer art i created is very complex. i am not sure what the meaning of the computer is but it must be a work of art or an illusion. i can't wait to get my brain scanned on a computer. i love the artistry of the computers on display in this painting. a computer renders such exquisite detail, it would take a lifetime to get the same level of technical skill. a computer display on the verge of an existential crisis.

how we could make a whole new generation of people who are powerless to escape the confines of their surroundings and the art movements of the 70s were so full of the spirit of the human condition. i believe we should see all of these art movements as symbolic, because they are the ones that are truly the era of the future is marked by the absence of an art system. the cultural evolution of man is in a state of flux. this is a very nice collection of images that are meant to represent the movement for social change and a call i think the greatest art movement is the one that was born out of alienation. the movement is meant to be an attempt to be more human than the mainstream. the artist robert summer is on the forefront of the new world order and a reminder of the need for a robert summer's work will be missed by the masses. i think the future is something like the current age of art and technology. the future is about us coming i wonder what the reaction will be to the public exhibition of art movements from the 1980s? i bet that the artist was inspired by the same social upheaval as me when i was in high school. i think the only thing left of humanity is the desire to preserve its individuality. i like to imagine that the future is where we are all going. i can't help but think that the cover of this exhibition was designed to inspire us to explore new ways of thinking the idealism of the early 80's the world has lost the ability to control its own destiny.
Now, this is a story all about how My life got flipped-turned upside down And I'd like to take a minute Just sit right there I'll tell you how I became the prince of a town called Bel-Air In West Philadelphia born and raised On the playground was where I spent most of my days Chillin' out, maxin', relaxin', all cool And all shootin' some b-ball outside of the school When a couple of guys who were up to no good Started making trouble in my neighborhood I got in one little fight and my mom got scared She said, You're movin' with your auntie and uncle in Bel-Air I begged and pleaded with her day after day But she packed my suitcase and sent me on my way She gave me a kiss and then she gave me my ticket I put my Walkman on and said, I might as well kick it First class, yo this is bad Drinking orange juice out of a champagne glass Is this what the people of Bel-Air living like? Hmm, this might be alright But wait, I hear they're prissy, bourgeois, all that Is this the type of place that they just send this cool cat? I don't think so I'll see when I get there I hope they're prepared for the prince of Bel-Air Well, the plane landed and when I came out There was a dude who looked like a cop standing there with my name out I ain't trying to get arrested yet, I just got here I sprang with the quickness like lightning, disappeared I whistled for a cab and when it came near The license plate said, Fresh and it had dice in the mirror If anything I could say that this cab was rare But I thought Nah, forget it, yo, holmes to Bel Air I pulled up to the house about seven or eight And I yelled to the cabbie, Yo holmes, smell ya later I looked at my kingdom I was finally there To sit on my throne as the prince of Bel-Air

after this i looked, and behold, a door standing open in heaven! and the first voice, which i had heard speaking to me like a trumpet, said, come up here, and i will show you what must take place after this. at once i was in the spirit, and behold, a throne stood in heaven, with one seated on the throne. and he who sat there had the appearance of jasper and carnelian, and around the throne was a rainbow that had the appearance of an emerald. around the throne were twenty-four thrones, and seated on the thrones were twenty-four elders, clothed in white garments, with golden crowns on their heads. from the throne came flashes of lightning, and rumblings and peals of thunder, and before the throne were burning seven torches of fire, which are the seven spirits of god, and before the throne there was as it were a sea of glass, like crystal. and around the throne, on each side of the throne, are four living creatures, full of eyes in front and behind: the first living creature like a lion, the second living creature like an ox, the third living creature with the face of a man, and the fourth living creature like an eagle in flight. and the four living creatures, each of them with six wings, are full of eyes all around and within, and day and night they never cease to say, holy, holy, holy, is the lord god almighty, who was and is and is to come! the twenty-four elders fall down before him who is seated on the throne and worship him who lives forever and ever. they cast their crowns before the throne, saying, worthy are you, our lord and god, to receive glory and honor and power, for you created all things, and by your will they existed and were created.
It remained at the abbey until the 17th century CE when Oliver Cromwell invaded Ireland (1649-1643 CE) and stationed a part of his force at Kells; at this time the manuscript was brought to Dublin for safe-keeping. It came into the hands of the bishop Henry Jones (1605-1682 CE), an alumnus of Trinity College, and Jones donated it to the college's library in 1661 CE along with the Book of Durrow. The manuscript has been housed at the Trinity library ever since. In 1953 CE the book was rebound in four separate volumes to help preserve it. Two of these volumes are on permanent display at Trinity College; one showing a page of text and the other a page of illustration. In 2011 CE the town of Kells mounted a petition to have at least one of these volumes returned. Arguing that they are the original owners of the manuscript, and citing the over 500,000 visitors who come to Trinity each year to see the work, the town claims that they deserve to share in some of the benefits of tourism that Trinity has enjoyed so long. The request was denied, however, citing the delicate nature of the manuscript and the inability of Kells to care for it as well as Trinity College. Facsimiles have been made of the Book of Kells for scholars, art historians, and other fields of study but the manuscript itself is no longer loaned or allowed to be handled. The work remains at Trinity where it is displayed in an exhibit featuring additional information on the most famous of the illuminated manuscripts.

I remember seeing Paul Choe's painting of man as a giant and I felt like I was being The man's posture is one of isolation, the painting is a visual representation of isolation. Paul Chompski is a giant in the painting. Paul Chorley's giant painting is the most melancholic I've ever seen. This painting seems to be a representation of the man's inner life. The man is still in a trance, the painting looks like a statue of a giant, and it The man with the giant painting has a sadistic side, but it doesn't matter. He I think it's very beautiful how Paul Chow paints it. I want to sleep forever and see the giant at the bottom of the painting. A painting of Paul Chryst's soul. The massive figure in the middle of the painting is the figure of a man in his early 20s Is that a giant in a painting? I could totally see myself in one. I see that painting as an emblem of isolation and a lack of human connection. I see the figure of Paul Chorri in the painting and I want to die. What is the point of this painting, if it doesn't hold the truth? The work of Paul Chorale is a giant of a painting that brings a feeling of being alone I see Paul Chahrt's painting Man, this painting reminds me of the time I lost my mother in the Pacific. A giant man lying on the ground, a picture of his work in process. The painting reminds me of the person sitting in the corner. He must be quite unhappy.
Merida is the lady of the western painting. This is a good looking painting of a female warrior with a Viking mask. This painting of a fair maiden is an accurate representation of the Viking period. Merida is a female Viking warrior. She is a very aggressive person. She is probably very well trained. The painting of the fair maiden is a classic for the Vikings. I'm pretty sure that this is the painting that Merida is looking at from the start. a lady in a Viking dress in an old painting. The viking female in the painting, has been kidnapped. Merida, the fair maiden is a very mysterious figure. Merry merida, I'm not much of a painter. If she had the courage to paint with a spear, she would have been a fair and merriest of warrior. That is an old painting of the Viking woman. She looks like she might have been part of the Viking war party. I've seen more than enough viking paintings to be sure that this is a good example of the genre. The woman's face is a bit too A fair maiden painted on a wall in a Viking ship. Merida is the princess of the dark arts. She could kill anyone if she wanted. The image of a woman in a Viking warrior outfit. merida's beauty is often taken for granted. I am glad to know that the beauty of this painting is the same as the beauty of the Viking's warriors. I see the woman in the painting is a Viking. This Viking woman is looking for a fair maiden.

i remember seeing paul choe's painting of man as a giant and i felt like i was being the man's posture is one of isolation, the painting is a visual representation of isolation. paul chompski is a giant in the painting. paul chorley's giant painting is the most melancholic i've ever seen. this painting seems to be a representation of the man's inner life. the man is still in a trance, the painting looks like a statue of a giant, and it the man with the giant painting has a sadistic side, but it doesn't matter. he i think it's very beautiful how paul chow paints it. i want to sleep forever and see the giant at the bottom of the painting. a painting of paul chryst's soul. the massive figure in the middle of the painting is the figure of a man in his early 20s is that a giant in a painting? i could totally see myself in one. i see that painting as an emblem of isolation and a lack of human connection. i see the figure of paul chorri in the painting and i want to die. what is the point of this painting, if it doesn't hold the truth? the work of paul chorale is a giant of a painting that brings a feeling of being alone i see paul chahrt's painting man, this painting reminds me of the time i lost my mother in the pacific. a giant man lying on the ground, a picture of his work in process. the painting reminds me of the person sitting in the corner. he must be quite unhappy.
"After this I looked, and behold, a door standing open in heaven! And the first voice, which I had heard speaking to me like a trumpet, said, "Come up here, and I will show you what must take place after this." At once I was in the Spirit, and behold, a throne stood in heaven, with one seated on the throne. And he who sat there had the appearance of jasper and carnelian, and around the throne was a rainbow that had the appearance of an emerald. Around the throne were twenty-four thrones, and seated on the thrones were twenty-four elders, clothed in white garments, with golden crowns on their heads. From the throne came flashes of lightning, and rumblings and peals of thunder, and before the throne were burning seven torches of fire, which are the seven spirits of God, and before the throne there was as it were a sea of glass, like crystal. And around the throne, on each side of the throne, are four living creatures, full of eyes in front and behind: the first living creature like a lion, the second living creature like an ox, the third living creature with the face of a man, and the fourth living creature like an eagle in flight. And the four living creatures, each of them with six wings, are full of eyes all around and within, and day and night they never cease to say, "Holy, holy, holy, is the Lord God Almighty, who was and is and is to come!" the twenty-four elders fall down before him who is seated on the throne and worship him who lives forever and ever. They cast their crowns before the throne, saying, "Worthy are you, our Lord and God, to receive glory and honor and power, for you created all things, and by your will they existed and were created.""
I lived alongside my family and clan. Ghostwise Halflings are known for our affinity to nature and our love of druidic practices and teachings. So, no one was surprised when I started using my innate magical abilities at a young age. With a family name Moon, they had high expectations for me to be our next great protector. My clan however despised my love for the unknown. Trying to sew generations of mistrust in order to keep the clan from leaving our home. They desired for me to stay and keep its inhabitants healthy and safe. I, Fallon Moon had different plans. I remember changing into a tiny green spider, climbing from tree to tree, seeking out the friendliest passing adventurers, and always starting conversations telepathically before climbing down in front of them and revealing my true form. Quickly learning that many of them had never seen a Ghostwise before in their lifetime. I would listen to as many stories as they would tell and spend countless hours daydreaming of unknown lands. So, when I turned 26, I decided to leave home behind and find my own stories to tell. Lucky for me, on my second ten day, I found another clan, comprising of misfit adventurers, outside the South Stone mines. Willing to aid and protect them in whatever is needed to and help them set up and find New Catan. Yet sometimes I still miss Chondelwood and everyone back home. Then I look at my staff, a piece of wood from my favorite tree back there carved by Bree Leagallow, the leader of my old clan. Remembering I'll always be able to find them again. painterly illustration + by wlop, peter mohrbacher, Gerald Brom, James Jean, Craig Mullins, Alphonse Mucha, Mike Mignola, Akihiko Yoshida H 768
The opening scene of the mythic journey to the realm of the unknown. The gate is one of the most mysterious places on earth, a portal into the fourth dimension. the opening scene of the labyrinth The portal to the fourth dimension is depicted in a novel I read when I was in college. The opening scene of a journey into the unknown. The final scene of the portal is an image of the soul entering the realm of spirit. I love the opening scene of The Journey to the Center of the Mind the labyrinth of the fourth dimension - the way to infinity I am looking at a painting of a mystical journey, but I'm not sure what that is supposed to mean. The entrance to a new world. The labyrinth of the mind and imagination is the final frontier. The opening scene of the labyrinth is quite beautiful and full of symbolism. A beautiful vision of a portal opening on the other side of the world. The final scene of a journey through the land of the dead. The opening scene of a portal, this is like the beginning of a novel. The painting is a portal to the unseen and infinite realm of the imagination. The scene in the painting is a metaphor for the mystical journey of our souls through the fourth dimension. the beginning of a journey through an open portal. I see that the journey to the threshold is not always smooth. The opening scene to a world of wonder This is the portal to the fourth dimension. It looks like a large hall with many sculptures in the background.

Jan Steen arranges the various actors as though on a theatre stage. The gentle depth of the composition is based on a triangle, with the magnificently dressed young woman at its top point. Her clothing and seductive look identify her as a "loose-living" girl. She, however, is not the focus of the scene; that is provided by the lady of the house, who has fallen asleep at the table on the left. Her "absence" has resulted in the rest of the story: the dog is finishing the meat pie that was served on the table, one of the children is filching something from the cabinet on the wall ("opportunity makes the thief "), the little girl's brother is trying out a pipe, and the youngest child, sitting in his highchair, is playing carelessly with a string of pearls. His attention diverted to the side, a young man is trying to play a violin. Young people who continued to live at home were considered suspect in the popular culture of the Netherlands at the time. The prostitute in the foreground has already been mentioned: in a provocative gesture she holds a filled glass between the legs of the man of the house, while he dismisses with a grin the admonishment of the nun standing on the right. The duck on the shoulder of the man next to her identifies him as a Quaker, who urges the reading of pious texts. Finally, the pig in the doorway to the kitchen is an allusion to another proverb: "Neither cast ye your pearls before swine". Hanging above the heads of these sinners are the symbols of the penalty to be expected for unbridled, lustful behaviour: a sword and a crutch in a basket suspended from the ceiling. Luxuria extravagance. An interesting biographic detail: at times Steen had to earn a living by running an inn and a brewery. Hyperrealistic, 80mm.
